A simple [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app that can be deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com).


Streamlit's wizardry go far beyond Machine Learning.

To illustrate that, I coded a simple HTML table scraper in ~100 lines of Python.

You can check what the apps does in this video:

The app is simple to use:

- Paste any Webpage
- Select a table
- Export it to csv

If you wanted to try the app for yourself, it's currently deployed on Heroku [here](https://html-table-scraper.herokuapp.com/)
