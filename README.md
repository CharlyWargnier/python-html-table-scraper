# HTML table scraper

A simple interactive *HTML table scraper* app based on [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).
The app that can be deployed to [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

Streamlit's wizardry go far beyond Machine Learning! To illustrate that, I coded a simple HTML table scraper in ~100 lines of Python 🐍.

You can check what the apps does in this video:

The app is simple to use:
